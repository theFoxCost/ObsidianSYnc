Absolutely! Here's a complete **GitHub-style `README.md`** that documents your full PC ↔️ Phone sync system, including:

* 🖥 PC monitor script (`MonitorSend.py`)
* 📱 Phone Flask receiver script
* How they work **together**
* Setup instructions
* Requirements
* Folder structure
* Next steps

# 🔄 PC ↔️ Phone File Sync via Wi-Fi

A minimal Python-based system to **monitor files on your PC** and **sync them automatically to your Android phone** over a local Wi-Fi network using a Flask API server.

> 🚫 No cloud. No cables. Just fast, local sync.

---

## 📦 Features

- ✅ Auto-detect new and modified files
- ✅ Sync to phone over HTTP
- ✅ Create missing folders remotely
- ✅ Simple setup using Python only
- ✅ Keeps everything locally in your phone

---

## 📁 Project Structure

```bash
📂 PC/
├── MonitorSend.py        # Main sync script
├── data/
│   └── last_state.json   # Snapshot state
├── requirements.txt      # Requests library

📂 Phone/
└── phone_server.py       # Flask API receiver
    └── received_files/   # Synced data saved here
````

---

## ⚙️ Requirements

Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

`requirements.txt` contains:

```
requests
flask
```

---

## 🖥 PC Script – `MonitorSend.py`

This script:

* Scans the current folder
* Detects new or modified files
* Sends them via HTTP to your phone
* Creates folders remotely if missing

### 🔧 Configuration

Set the IP of your phone in the script:

```python
API_URL = "http://192.168.100.6:5000/upload"  # Replace with your phone IP
FOLDER_URL = "http://192.168.100.6:5000/folder"
```

### ▶️ Run it:

```bash
python MonitorSend.py
```

---

## 📱 Phone Script – `phone_server.py`

This script:

* Runs a Flask server
* Accepts files and folders
* Saves everything in `received_files/` where the script lives

### ▶️ Run it (on your phone):

Install **Pydroid 3** or any mobile Python environment.

Then run:

```python
from flask import Flask, request
from pathlib import Path

app = Flask(__name__)
save_path = Path("received_files")
save_path.mkdir(exist_ok=True)

@app.route("/upload", methods=["POST"])
def upload_file():
    uploaded_file = request.files['file']
    filename = uploaded_file.filename
    full_path = save_path / filename
    uploaded_file.save(full_path)
    return f"✅ File saved: {filename}", 200

@app.route("/folder", methods=["POST"])
def create_folder():
    foldername = request.form.get("foldername")
    if foldername:
        (save_path / foldername).mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True)
        return f"📁 Folder created: {foldername}", 200
    return "❌ No foldername provided", 400

app.run(host="0.0.0.0", port=5000)
```

You'll see:

```bash
* Running on http://192.168.100.6:5000
```

Use that IP in the PC script.

## 🔄 How It Works Together

1. Phone runs `phone_server.py` (waits for uploads)
2. PC runs `MonitorSend.py` (monitors files)
3. When:

   * New file → sent to `/upload`
   * New/updated folder → POST to `/folder`
4. Phone saves all files in `received_files/`

---

## ✅ Examples

### File detection and sync:

```bash
📦 1 file(s) to send.
📤 Sent: hello.txt
✅ Done at 14:22:18
```

### Folder creation:

```bash
📁 Created folder: notes
```

Would you also like me to generate the `requirements.txt` and `.gitignore`, or package this as a ZIP you can upload to GitHub directly?
